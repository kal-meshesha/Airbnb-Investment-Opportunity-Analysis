# Airbnb Investment Opportunity Analysis***
## Chicago Market | Revenue Modeling | Excel Data Analytics Project
### **Executive Summary**
A real estate investor wants to determine whether investing in an Airbnb property in Chicago is financially viable and which neighborhood and property type would maximize returns.
Using Chicago Airbnb listing data, I conducted data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and revenue modeling to evaluate market demand, guest satisfaction, and revenue potential of high-performing hosts.
The analysis identifies high-demand neighborhoods, top-performing property types, and revenue benchmarks for successful hosts — providing actionable insights to guide investment decisions and reduce financial risk.
### **Business Problem**
The short-term rental market is competitive and location-sensitive. Investors often lack clear answers to critical questions such as:

Where is Airbnb demand strongest?

Which property types deliver the highest guest satisfaction?

What level of revenue can be realistically expected?

Without structured analysis, investment decisions rely on assumptions rather than data.
This project solves that problem by transforming raw Airbnb data into strategic insights that inform smarter investment decisions.
### **Methodology**
The analysis followed a structured data analytics workflow:

*1\. Data Cleaning \& Preparation*
Removed duplicate listings

Handled missing values and zero-price entries

Standardized currency and numeric formats

Validated occupancy and review score fields

*2\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

Used PivotTables to analyze listing distribution by neighborhood

Calculated average review scores by property type

Compared listing volume, ratings, and occupancy indicators

*3\. Revenue Modeling*

Revenue was not directly provided in the dataset, so it was estimated using:

Revenue = Price × Estimated Occupancy

“Successful hosts” were defined as:

Review rating above 4.5 stars

Occupancy rate above 75%

Revenue was then aggregated by neighborhood to identify high-performing areas.

These methods were chosen to provide practical, business-focused insights while working within real-world data limitations.

### **Specific Skills Used| Tools \& Technologies**

### **Analytical Skills**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **Results \& Business Recommendations**

**Key Findings**

*1\. High-Demand Neighborhoods*

Near North Side (1,077 listings)

West Town (774 listings)

Near West Side (665 listings)

These neighborhoods show strong market activity and demand.

*2\. High-Performing Property Types*

Shared Rooms

Private Rooms

Entire Homes

These property types receive the highest average review ratings, indicating strong guest satisfaction.

*3\. Revenue Potential*

Successful hosts (rating > 4.5 and occupancy > 75%) generate significant revenue, especially in:

West Town

Near North Side

Lake View

### Business Recommendations

Prioritize investment in high-demand neighborhoods such as West Town or Near North Side.

Focus on property types with strong review performance to ensure occupancy stability.

Maintain high guest satisfaction to sustain revenue growth.

A data-driven investment strategy significantly reduces risk and improves long-term profitability.

### **Next Steps \& Limitations**

**Limitations**

Revenue was estimated, not directly provided.

Occupancy was inferred using available indicators.

External factors (seasonality, regulation changes, economic shifts) were not included.

**Next Steps (If More Time Were Available)**

Incorporate seasonal trend analysis

Conduct sentiment analysis using review data

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

Compare Chicago to other major cities for benchmarking

Develop a predictive revenue forecasting model
